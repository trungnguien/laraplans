## [unreleased]

### Added

- Carbon 2
- Method `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Models\PlanSubscription::scopeExcludeCanceled`
- Method `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Models\PlanSubscription::scopeExcludeImmediatelyCanceled`

## [3.0.0] - 2020-05-25

### Added
- Now the subscription returned by the `subscription()` method in the `PlanSubscriber` trait is resolved by a class compatible with `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Contracts\SubscriptionResolverInterface`. Default resolver is `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\SubscriptionResolver`. Behavior and logic not changed. [Documentation](https://laraplans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#subscription-resolving).
- `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Events\SubscriptionSaved`
- `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Events\SubscriptionSaving`

### Changed
- Now using `Event::dispatch()` instead of `Event::fire()`. PR #49. Requires **Laravel 5.8 or newer.**

### Removed
- Method `Gerardojbaez\Laraplans\Models\PlanSubscription::boot()`, logic was moved to event listeners.

## [2.2.0] - 2018-02-23

### Added
- Support for Laravel 5.4 and Laravel 5.5
- `SubscriptionDeleted` event.
- Documentation website http://laraplans.readthedocs.io

### Fixed
- Renamed `user_id` to `subscribable_id`, fixes #30

## [2.1.0] - 2017-11-27

### Added
- `canceled_immediately` column to `plan_subscriptions` table
- `isCanceledImmediately()` method to `PlanSubscription` model.
- `SubscriptionBuilderInterface`
- `SubscriptionCreated` event.

### Changed
- Now when a subscription is *immediately* canceled the `canceled_immediately` column will be set to true.
- `ends_at` column is no longer overrided to accomodate the `canceled_at` date. This ends date will remain untouched.
- `isActive()` method will return `false` if subscription was canceled immediately, even if the `ends_at` column is in the future.
- Now `newSubscription()` method in `PlanSubscriber` trait is expecting a `SubscriptionBuilderInterface` implementation through Laravel's `App::make()`.
