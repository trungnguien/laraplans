Configurations
==============

You can configure what models to use, list of positive words and the list of features your app and your plans will use.

Definitions:
- **Positive Words**: Used to tell if a particular feature is *enabled*. E.g., if the feature ``listing_title_bold`` has the value ``Y`` (*Y* is one of the positive words) then, that means it's *enabled*.
- **Features**: List of features that your app and plans use.

Take a look to the ``config/laraplans.php`` config file for more details.
